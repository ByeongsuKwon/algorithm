#poker game
##phase 1
###1. generate random card
###2. make decision to continue game
###3. that's all

#what functions will be implemented during phase 2?
##I'm thinking about two ways.
###1. calculating probability
####1. 1. just for one player. that is, he knows only community card and his own hand.
####1. 2. for all player cards. that is, all in mode (case all players know others hands)
###2. find winner.

###I don't know which one should be built first right now.
